# Getting and Cleaning Data

## Course assignment
R script "run_analysis.R" does the following:

* Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
* Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement.
* Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
* Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names.
* From the data set in previous step, creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.

When run, the script produces "tidy.txt" which is a tidy dataset. Comments have been used in the script to make things clear and understandable.
